# Guideline on how to contribute

First of all, thanks for wanting to contribute! We hope you can find all the information you are looking for, regarding contributions, in this document. If not, feel free to suggest a modification via a pull request.

## Ways to contribute

There are many ways to contribute, 

- if you don't want to read or write code you may [have a question or suggestion](#you-have-a-question-or-suggestion), or have an idea for [new functionality](#you-have-an-idea-for-new-functionality),
- if you only want to read code you may [contribute with documentation](#you-want-to-contribute-with-documentation) either checking or writing docstrings, tutorials, or information files,
- if you want to use the existing code you may want to [add examples or tests](#you-want-to-add-examples-or-tests)
- if you feel like contributing to the existing code you may want to [write or improve some code](#you-want-to-write-or-improve-some-code) or [implement some functionality](#you-want-to-implement-new-functionality),
- or, maybe you were using the program and you [have found a bug](#you-have-found-a-bug) and wish to let us know.

## You have a question or suggestion

Great! You are helping us create a more clear and improved repository. Simply raise a [corresponding issue](https://github.com/CarlosAndresd/template/issues/new?assignees=&labels=question&template=questions-or-suggestions.md&title=Question+or+Suggestion)

## You have found a bug

Please, let us know what happened with the [corresponding issue](https://github.com/CarlosAndresd/template/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report_template.yml&title=Bug+Report).

## You want to write or improve some code

Thanks! when writing new code please keep in mind the [following guidelines](#guidelines-when-adding-new-code)


## You want to add examples or tests

Thanks! Please follow the [guidelines to add new code](#guidelines-when-adding-new-code), and in addition to that do the following:

- If you are adding tests, make sure that they are run automatically.
- If you are adding examples, please document well the examples and the use of functions in them.
- In both cases, make sure to add the tests or examples in the correct directory.

## You have an idea for new functionality 

All new ideas are welcome, please provide details for your idea with the [following issue](https://github.com/CarlosAndresd/template/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=new_functionality.yml&title=New+Functionality)

## You want to implement new functionality 

Thanks! Please follow the [guidelines to add new code](#guidelines-when-adding-new-code). If the functionality was suggested in an issue, please make sure to reply or close the issue. If the functionality was not suggested in an issue, please make an issue and then reply or close it.

## You want to contribute with documentation 

Great! In this repository documentation is made automatically using Sphinx and HTML webpages, so please make sure to follow that convention.



## Guidelines when adding new code

- The prefered docstrings style is [Numpy-Style Docstrings](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).
- Follow the code style guidelines of [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). This is easily done if you write code using an IDE like PyCharm
- When defining new functions and variables, please use the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standard. In a nutshell:
	- Function names should be lowercase.
	- Variable names should be lowercase.
- Whenever possible, add in the function docstrins a simple example of how to use the function. Also, make use of default parameters to be able to use the functions in a simple way.
